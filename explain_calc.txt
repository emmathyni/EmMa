To calculate an index the program uses the specified area under the band for both
peaks and divides their areas to get an index. First a version of binary search has
been implemented to look for the closest possible wavenumber data point to the
received intervals. Then a baseline correction using a linear function is performed.
The baseline correction is only performed on the desired peaks. Finally, the
integration is done using the trapezoidal method and an area for a peak
is calculated.
