To calculate an index the program uses the specified area under the band for both
peaks and divides their areas to get an index. First a version of binary search has
been implemented to look for the closest possible wavenumber data point to the
received intervals. Then a baseline correction using a linear function is performed.
The baseline correction is only performed on the desired peaks. Finally, the
integration is done using the trapezoidal method and an area for a peak
is calculated. Using the areas of the peak of the functional group and the reference
peak the index is calculated using the formula:

Index=(area of functional peak)/(area of reference peak).

The FWHM of the peaks is calculated after the baseline of the peaks has been corrected.
It is calculated by finding all instances of a y-value within a peak going from lower
than half of the maximum value within that peak to higher than half of the maximum
value of the peak. The corresponding x-values are also noted. The FWHM is calculated
by taking the distance between the outermost noted x-values.
