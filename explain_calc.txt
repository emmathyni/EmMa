To calculate an index the program uses the specified area under the band for both
peaks and divides their areas to get an index. First a version of binary search has
been implemented to look for the closest possible wavenumber data point to the
received intervals. Then there is a baseline correction using a linear function.
Finally, the integration is done with the trapezoidal method and an area for a peak
is calculated.

To estimate an error the following has been implemented:
