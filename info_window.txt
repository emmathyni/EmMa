EmMa is a program for facilitating kinetics calculations for FTIR spectra.
The program uses data from a .csv file on the format (...................).To
select a file please press the 'Browse' button and select your file. Then please
select the data types for your specific file (eg. if the data is in transmittance
or absorbance and if it is in percent or arbitrary units). There is a possibility
to plot the given data in the given format or in absorbance by pressing 'Plot spectra'
or 'Convert spectra to absorbance' and then pressing 'Plot spectra'.

To calculate an index please select your plastic type or select 'Create own interval'
to create a custom interval to consider. If plastic type is selected, a series of pre-
chosen intervals are available for you to select. The interval is the band ranges for
the interesting peak and the second interval is for the reference peak. If 'Create own
interval' is selected
