EmMa is a program for facilitating kinetics calculations for FTIR spectra.
The program uses data from a .csv file on the format (...................).To
select a file please press the 'Browse' button and select your file. Then please
select the data types for your specific file (eg. if the data is in transmittance
or absorbance and if it is in percent or arbitrary units). There is a possibility
to plot the given data in the given format or in absorbance by pressing 'Plot spectra'
or 'Convert spectra to absorbance' and then pressing 'Plot spectra'.

To calculate an index please select your plastic type or select 'Create own interval'
to create a custom interval to consider. If plastic type is selected, a series of pre-
chosen intervals are available for you to select. The first interval is the band ranges
for the interesting peak and the second interval is for the reference peak. If 'Create
own interval' is selected, you may enter your own intervals for the peak and reference
peak. Please make sure to press 'OK' before continuing. After selecting your desired
peaks press 'Calculate index'. This will prompt a plot of your data with the peaks
marked in the plot. The calculated index with be printed at the top of the plot. The
full width at half maximum (FWHM) for both peaks will be also be printed in the window.
