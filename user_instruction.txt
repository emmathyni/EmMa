EmMa is a program for facilitating kinetics calculations for FTIR spectra. The
program uses data from a .csv file on the format 1,2345e+/-001,1,2345e+/-e001
or 123,45,123,45. To select a file please press the 'Browse' button and select
your file. Then please select the data types for your specific file (eg. if the
data is in transmittance or absorbance and if it is in percent or arbitrary units).
There is a possibility to plot the given data in the given format or in absorbance
by pressing 'Plot spectrum' or 'Convert spectrum to absorbance' and then pressing
'Plot spectrum'.

To calculate an index please select your plastic type or select 'Create own interval'
to create a custom interval to consider. If plastic type is selected, a series of
pre-chosen intervals is available for you to select. The first interval is the band
range for the functional group peak and the second interval is for the reference peak.
If 'Create own interval' is selected, you may enter your own intervals for the
functional group peak and reference peak. Please make sure to press 'OK' before
continuing. After selecting your desired peaks press 'Calculate index'. This will
prompt a plot of your data with the peaks marked in the plot. The calculated index
with be printed at the top of the plot. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) for both
peaks will be also be printed in the window.
